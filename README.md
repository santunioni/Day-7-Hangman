# Day-7-Hangman

1. This is a functioning hangman game.
2. You will need python3.9 to run it because MyPy type hinting configurations.
3. Run it through `python3.9 main.py`

The game was written as part of the [#100-Days-of-Code course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).    
The code is written by me, but the visuals were taken from the course.
